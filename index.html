          ATI's film review immediately helped identify key areas of opportunity
          in my development. They provided digestible and valuable insights
          which have given me a clear path to become a better player.

          I just finished my first game [since our session] and played the best
          game of my life. I had a good gap and rushed the puck up almost end to
          end about 4 or 5 times and got player of the game. I think your film
          review helped with my gap, not by me or even past the blue line.
          Hearing I am a good forward skater gave me a lot more confidence to
          rush the puck.

          Thank you very much. My biggest development target after your analysis
          is gap control on the defensive end. In the attacking direction, I
          agree that I should play with more confidence so I could play much
          more freely with the puck.
